# WNV transmission in _Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes in Emilia-Romagna

## Repository overview

This repository contains code to develop and run the spatiotemporal mixed-effects regression models described in the paper 'Meteorological and environmental drivers of West Nile virus prevalence in _Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes in Emilia-Romagna, Italy in 2013 to 2022.'

The raw entomological and ornithological data analysed in the paper were obtained through a data sharing agreement and cannot be openly shared; however, the estimated weekly mosquito WNV prevalence and all meteorological and environmental variables are made available in this repository. 

All analyses can be run from the main.R file, which calls scripts to run the analysis (contained in the scripts folder) and functions (contained in the R folder).
